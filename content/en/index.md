### **Journey** to the unknown Java world

I am a Java and software engineering enthusiast, and this is a place where i will share my journey to learn software engineering and explore Java and it's frameworks. The more i learn, the more i understand that there are no single way to achieve technological related goals, and for me... this is the way.

During exploration, i found some interesting experience and i will share it as a set tutorial to you :
- Java fundamental
- Java web framework with [Blade]()
- Java web template with [Jetbrick]()
- Java database operation using [Anima]()
- REST operation
- REST basic authentication operation
- REST CRUD operation
- and so on...
